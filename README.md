Rainy Relaxation


	For my song, when I was thinking of how I wanted to organize the melodies, what I wanted was to have distinct building and relaxing parts of this song. I liked this idea for a relaxing/study music because I think that it helps to draw the listener in with an interesting melody, and then slowly helps the listener relax through the second half of the song. I also drew upon aspects of nature, which I tried to reflect in the music. Throughout the song, the background mimics raindrops by playing short notes on the harp. The song also begins and ends with only the raindrops, which I think helps ground the listener at the beginning and end in nature. Then, during the middle portion of the song, I used arpeggios to build up and reduce the energy of the song. All the while, I tried to balance keeping the song interesting but not too distracting by using similar melodies, but adding layers with different instruments and inverting the directions of the arpeggios in the second half. Hopefully by doing this, the music helps the listener settle down and relax by the end of the song. There is also an aspect of symmetry throughout the song, where the second half of the song is a reflection of the first half. I think this helps the relaxing vibe of the song because there are aspects that are consistent throughout the song, but also different. Also, the second half is descending arpeggios, which hopefully adds a sense of calm and settling for the listener.
